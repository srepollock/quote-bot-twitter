Built with NodeJS.

Use the npm scripts. It will encrypt/decrypt before doing anything dangerous. Testing is minimal, just setup and run the local server (server.js) and change out the URLs. Going to change to env variables later on.

Testing will run the function locally. Still lots of templating stuff, but good enough to get going and clean up for a tutorial later.

## Deployment

Sent to an AWS Lambda server and deployed. Triggers with a AWS CloudWatch trigger.
